	One-line paragraph

<p>
	A much longer paragraph describing the difference between a single-line paragraph and a multi-line paragraph,
	just by visually being of much greater size and shape. Having no other means to verify it's "multi-lineability"
	than hoping by now, the text has wrapped to atleast a second line (or more, depending on screen-size).

Include all of the above again, this time wrapped in a constrained `<div>` to see how they look in that setting.
