<h3>This header has level 3</h3>

<p>
	The headers above should cover most scenarios - Myself, I wouldn't ever create as many levels for
	anyone to use in the WYSIWYG editor of Umbraco.

<h1>Important point</h1>
<p>
	So now's the time to start building the CSS to be very actively targeting some or all of the various
	elements on th page(s).
</p>

<h2>Less important point</h2>
<p>
	Allowing editors to create headers of multiple levels, makes it much harder to maintain
	the look and feel. Let alone consistency, which easily goes the way of the Dodo.
</p>

<h3>Subtlety</h3>
<p>
	Worst case scenario, this should really be the smallest level of header allowed
	in a standard article.
</p>

<h4>Brevity for brevity's sake</h4>
<p>
	As it says - let&#8217;s try that.
</p>
<p>
	One-line paragraph
</p>

<p>
	A much longer paragraph describing the difference between a single-line paragraph and a multi-line paragraph,
	just by visually being of much greater size and shape. Having no other means to verify it's "multi-lineability"
	than hoping by now, the text has wrapped to atleast a second line (or more, depending on screen-size).

Include all of the above again, this time wrapped in a constrained `<div>` to see how they look in that setting.
