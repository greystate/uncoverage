<h2 id="sec1-headers">Headers</h2>

<p>
	Headers level 1–4 should cover most scenarios - Myself, I wouldn't ever create as many levels for
	anyone to use in the WYSIWYG editor of Umbraco.
</p>

<h1>Important point (level 1)</h1>
<p>
	So now's the time to start building the CSS to be very actively targeting some or all of the various
	elements on the page(s).
</p>

<h2>Less important point (level 2)</h2>
<p>
	Allowing editors to create headers of multiple levels, makes it much harder to maintain
	the look and feel. Let alone consistency, which easily goes the way of the Dodo.
</p>

<h3>Subtlety (level 3)</h3>
<p>
	Worst case scenario, this should really be the smallest level of header allowed
	in a standard article.
</p>

<h4>Brevity for brevity's sake (level 4)</h4>
<p>
	As it says - let&#8217;s try that.
</p>
<h2 id="sec1-paragraphs">Paragraphs</h2>

<p>
	One-line paragraph.
</p>

<p>
	A much longer paragraph describing the difference between a single-line paragraph and a multi-line paragraph,
	just by visually being of much greater size and shape. Having no other means to verify it's "multi-lineability"
	than hoping by now, the text has wrapped to atleast a second line (or more, depending on screen-size).
</p>

<h2 id="sec1-quotes">Quotes</h2>

<p>
	Here's a great quote from <em>Die Hard</em>, marked up as a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Only John can drive somebody that crazy</p>
	
	<footer>
		<cite>Holly McClane</cite>
	</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Another way to quote could be inline, e.g. when referencing the evil way Gollum says <q><em>She</em> can do it...</q> in <em>The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers</em>,
	keeping it as part of the sentence.
</p>

Include all of the above again, this time wrapped in a constrained `<div>` to see how they look in that setting.
