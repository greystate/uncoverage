# Uncoverage

This is an attempt to finally assemble a long page using as many combos of HTML as possible, so we can see if a given _base_ CSS file covers enough.

## Intended usage

When you've written a lot of CSS for the content of a site, copy the `dist/uncoverage.html` file onto your server, adding a `<link>` to your CSS
file and see how it renders. Chances are, there&#8217;s a couple scenarios
you didn't quite cover.

## TODO

- [ ] Quotes

- [ ] Links
- [ ] Lists (ordered, unordered, definition)
