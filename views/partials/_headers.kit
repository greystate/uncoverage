<h2 id="<!-- $prefix -->-headers">Headers</h2>

<p>
	Headers level 1â€“4 should cover most scenarios - Myself, I wouldn't ever create as many levels for
	anyone to use in the WYSIWYG editor of Umbraco.
</p>

<h1>Important point (level 1)</h1>
<p>
	So now's the time to start building the CSS to be very actively targeting some or all of the various
	elements on the page(s).
</p>

<h2>Less important point (level 2)</h2>
<p>
	Allowing editors to create headers of multiple levels, makes it much harder to maintain
	the look and feel. Let alone consistency, which easily goes the way of the Dodo.
</p>

<h3>Subtlety (level 3)</h3>
<p>
	Worst case scenario, this should really be the smallest level of header allowed
	in a standard article.
</p>

<h4>Brevity for brevity's sake (level 4)</h4>
<p>
	As it says - let&#8217;s try that.
