<p>
	Here's a great quote from <em>Die Hard</em>, marked up as a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Only John can drive somebody that crazy</p>
	
	<footer>
		<cite>Holly McClane</cite>
	</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Another way to quote could be inline, e.g. when referencing the evil way Gollum says <q><em>She</em> can do it...</q> in <em>The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers</em>,
	keeping it as part of the sentence.
